# GridSpiralDemo

\# Grid Spiral Demo



This is a small demo built with \*\*Unity\*\*.  

The idea is simple: you generate a number grid, and then the app reads it in a \*\*clockwise spiral\*\*, showing each number step by step with a little sound and pop animation.



\## What can you do?

\- Choose the number of \*\*rows and columns\*\* (from 2 to 20).

\- Automatically generate the \*\*grid\*\*.

\- Press \*\*Read\*\* to start the spiral traversal.

\- Watch each cell “pop” as it’s read while the sequence is written out.

\- Restart or quit using the UI buttons.



\## How to try it

\- Play in browser (WebGL): https://ricardoroman.itch.io/matrix  

\- Windows build: download the ZIP from the \*\*Releases\*\* tab.  

\- Source code: this repository.



\## Controls

1\. Enter rows and columns.

2\. Press \*\*Generate\*\*.

3\. Press \*\*Read\*\* to watch the spiral traversal.

4\. Use \*\*New\*\* to restart, \*\*Quit\*\* to exit.
